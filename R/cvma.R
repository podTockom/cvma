#' Cross-validated maximal association measures
#' 
#' A flexible interface for computing cross-validation-based measures of maximal association.
#' In an outer layer of V-fold cross validation, training samples are used to train a prediction 
#' algorithm for each outcome. Multiple algorithms may be ensembled using stacking (also known as 
#' super learning) based on V-2 fold cross-validation. An inner layer of V-1 cross validation is used 
#' to determine a user-specified combination of outcomes that maximizes a user-specified prediction 
#' criteria. The outer layer
#' validation sample is used to compute a user-specified cross-validated measure of performance of
#' the prediction algorithm for predicting the combined outcome that was computed in the training 
#' sample. Several common choices for outcome combinations (convex combination of
#' outcomes and single outcome that is most associated) and prediction criteria (nonparametric R^2,
#' negative log-likelihood, and area under ROC curve) are included; however, users may specify
#' their own criteria as well. The function returns the cross-validated summary measure for the
#' maximally combined outcome and, if desired, the cross-validated summary measure for each 
#' outcome.

#' TO DO: Figure out how future works (e.g., can plan() be specified internally
#' or externally?)
#' 
#' @param Y A matrix or data.frame of outcomes
#' @param X A matrix or data.frame of predictors
#' @param V Number of outer folds of cross-validation (nested cross-validation
#' uses V-1 and V-2 folds), so must be at least four. 
#' @param learners Super learner wrappers. See \code{SuperLearner::listWrappers}.
#' @param sl_control A list with named entries ensemble_fn, optim_risk_fn, weight_fn,
#' cv_risk_fn, family. Available functions can be viewed with \code{sl_control_options()}. See
#' \code{?sl_control_options} for more on how users may supply their own functions.  
#' @param y_weight_control A list with named entries ensemble_fn, optim_risk_fn, weight_fn,
#' cv_risk_fn. Available functions can be viewed with \code{y_weight_control_options()}. See
#' \code{?y_weight_control_options} for more on how users may supply their own functions.  
#' @param return_control A list with named entries \code{outer_weight} (whether to return outcome
#' weights for outer-most fold of CV, default \code{TRUE}), \code{outer_sl} (whether to return the 
#' super learner fit for each outcome on all the data), \code{all_y} (whether to return cross-validated
#' performance metrics for all outcomes), \code{all_learner_assoc} (whether to return cross-validation
#' performance metrics for all learners), \code{all_learner_fits} (whether to return all learner fits, 
#' which, while memory intensive, can be helpful if association measures based on different outcome 
#' weighting schemes are desired). 
#' @param scale Standardize each outcome to be mean zero with standard deviation 1.
#' 
#' @return \code{cv_assoc} returns risk for the entire procedure. The \code{cv_assoc_all_y} will return 
#' cross-validated performance metric for all the outcomes, including the confidence interval, p-value and
#' influence curve. \code{all_learner_assoc} will return for each outcome and learner 
#' cross-validated metric, confidence interval, associated p-value and influence curve.
#' The \code{sl_fit} will return Super Learner fit for each outcome and associated learner risks on 
#' all the data. In addition, it will return the fit for all learners based on all folds. 
#' The \code{outer_weight} will return the outcome weights obtained using outer-most fold of CV. 
#' \code{inner_weight} returns outcome weights obtained using inner-most fold of CV. Additinally, 
#' \code{all_learner_fits} returns all learner fits.
